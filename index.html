            <div class="text2">
                <u>Introduction</u><br>

                Computer is an electronic device device derived from the Latin word "computere" which means to
                calculate. It accepts raw facts and figures as an input which are isolated and uninterpreted through
                input device, process it according to the requirement of the user or command supplied by the user, store
                it before and after processing of require and produce a meaningful information as an output through an
                output device. Generally, computer works on IPO (Input-Process-Output) cycle. It follows GIGO (Garbage
                In Garbage Out) algorithm which means the output is always based on the input supplied by the user. The
                basic operation of computer is illustrated by following block diagram.

                <br><br>
                <u>Some characteristics/features of computer</u><br>
                The implementation of computers are not only limited/confined to a small area rather they are used from
                simple domestic task to complex scientific research to engineering. The use of computer are increasing
                day-by-day due to some special features or characteristics that computer own. Several features of
                computer are:
                <menu>
                    <li>Accuracy: Computer are the accurate machine that means result produced by computer are 100%
                        accurate. Since, it follows GIGO. The error that may arise in output is due to human not by a
                        computer.</li>
                    <li>Speed: Computer works on tremendously high speed. The operating speed of computer are measured
                        in millisecond, microsecond, picosecond and nanosecond which means computer can perform millions
                        and billions of instruction per second.</li>
                    <li>Storage: It is the area or unit which is capable of storing data and information for present and
                        future use. Storing data allows users to retrieve it whenever required. These days computer
                        comes with high volume of memory which are measured in Megabyte (1024 KB) , Gigabyte (1024 MB),
                        Terabyte(1024 GB) and Petabyte(1024 TB).</li>
                    <li>Versatility: Computer are generally design to serve more than one type of work. The
                        implementation of computer are not only limited to specific purpose, they solve general
                        requirement of the user and can be used in more than 1 type of job.</li>
                    <li>Diligence: The feature of computer in which computer doesn't get tired even after working for
                        long period of time. Computer can perform any number of task continuously until it is
                        accomplished. Once the instruction is given computer follows the command till it gets
                        terminated.</li>
                    <li>Automatic: Computer is an automatic machine. Once the instruction is generated it perform
                        accordingly until command is terminated. We don't have to issue continuous command in order to
                        operate the computer. This is called automatic.</li>
                </menu>
                <u>Applications/Implementations/Uses of computer</u><br>

                <u>Generations of Computer</u><br>
                History of computers dates back to mechanical era where computer were not used for general purpose. It
                takes long period of time to come to this phase. Development of computer had passed through different
                era from mechanical to electro mechanical to digital computer. The development in different electronic
                components, precise engineering and hi-tech technology has change the operation of computer drastically.
                Earlier computer were only used for specific purpose such as counting and performing basic mathematical
                operation. Later on, due to the necessity and requirement of user different general purpose computer
                were developed. Therefore, the classification of computer on the basis of major electronic component,
                their architecture and modes of operation is known as generations of computer. Five different
                generations of computer are listed below along with their distinct features.

                <u>Introduction to computer system</u><br>

                The word system refers to the integration of several individual independent unit which are integrated
                together to achieve a common objective or goal. System is a set of detailed method, procedure and
                routines created to carryout a specific activity, performs a duty or solve a problem. In a system
                different unit co-ordinate with each other so that they work as a whole. Without any of the unit whole
                system is affected.
                Similarly. computer system is also a Combination on hardware, software and peripherals which are
                organized together to run our computer system smoothly. Basically, our computer System works on IPO
                (Input Process Output) cycle. So, it is mandatory/compulsory to have different unit work together as a
                whole in order to convert raw facts and figure into meaningful information. Without any one of these
                unit computer starts malfunctioning.
                The design, arrangement, construction or organization a different parts of computer system is known as
                computer architecture. It is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer
                system. It is a framework which focus in how CPU performs internal operation. So computer architecture
                may also be define as the science and art of selection, inter connecting hardware components to create
                computer to meet functional performance and cost.

                example: device like keyboard, mouse, CPU, hard disk and RAM are commonly used hardware devices.<br><br>
                Software: The collection set of instruction is known as program.which performs some specific function.
                These programs are integrated together in order to work as a software. Software describes how hardware
                should function and helps in popper utilization and mobilization of computer hardware.For eg. Operating
                system, MS-Office, Billing software etc.<br><br>
                Data/Information: The raw facts and figures that are isolated, uninterpreted, and doesn't give any sense
                is known as data. Data are fed into the computer for processing as a input though Input devices.
                Whereas, the meaningful result obtained after processing data according to the supplied instruction is
                known as information. Information generally are the processed version of data which are obtain as output
                through output device.<br><br>
                People/User: It is the most important part of the computer system. People operate the computer hardware
                and create the computer software. People helps to generate command to operate the computer system.

                be touched and carried for being shown to other. It is permanent in nature. So that we can look after
                these output even there is no computer. Unlike soft copy output, these type of output does not need
                continuous supply of power. for example, Output produce in paper or other material by printer or plotter
                is known as hard copy output and the device is known as hard copy output device. The commonly used hard
                copy output devices are printer and plotter.

                <br><br>

                <u>Soft copy output:</u> Soft copy output refers to the data shown on display screen or produced by
                speaker. These type output is untouchable. It is temporary in nature that means, output cannot be
                carried for being shown to others. These types of output resides only when there is computer or
                continuous electric supply. It is non-portable compared to hard copy output. for example, Output
                produced on display screen or sound produced from speaker are soft copy output and whereas the device is
                known as soft copy output device. The commonly used soft copy output devices are speaker and monitor.

                ALU: ALU stands for Arithmetic Logic Unit. It is one of the most important unit of processing.
                Where actual execution of the instruction takes place during processing. It performs arithmetic and
                logical operations and controls speed of those operations as directed by control unit(CU). To be clear
                all the calculation and decision are made in ALU. The data and instruction are stored in the primary
                memory before processing, and are transferred when needed to the ALU. ALU is designed to perform
                fundamental mathematical operations such addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and logical
                Operation which perform Comparison between the two or more than two operands to make a solid decision
                also known as logical operation which consists of logical OR, logical AND and logical NOT.

                CU: Although, control unit doesn't perform any actual processing on the data, it acts as
                central nervous system for other component of the computer. It manages and co-ordinate the entire
                computer system. It obtain instruction from the program stored in the main memory, interprets the
                instruction accordingly and issue signal that cause other unit of the system to execute them. Basically,
                it controls overall operation of the computer. It also controls all other device input/output device
                connected to the CPU. It directs the movement of electrical signal between main memory to ALU and

                data
                to be deposited over them. Data are stored in the form of magnetic pattern. Some of the magnetic
                storage
                media are: Magnetic tape, Floppy disk and so on.

                    <li></li>2.1.1 Hard disk:</li> It is secondary storage device of Computer. It is an air-tight
                    sealed
                    consisting of number of magnetic disk (Platters) mounted on a spindle. It was introduced by IBM
                    in
                    1956 AD. It was first called Winchester disk. Unlike floppy disk it cannot be bent so it is
                    known as
                    hard disk. It is mainly used to store huge volume of data and programs permanently so it is
                    known as
                    non-volatile memory. The disk is divided into the number of concentric circles called tracks and
                    this tracks is divided into invisible segments called sectors.

                    <br><br>
                    <li>2.1.2 Floppy disk:</li> It is a round and flat disk made up of Mylar (Plastic material)
                    coated
                    with magnetic material. It is read-write memory as we can read from it as well as write onto it.
                    We
                    can access information from a floppy disk randomly. It has very small storage compared to hard
                    disk.

                2.2 Optical Storage: is also non-volatile secondary storage media. It is a flat round disk made
                up of plastic polycarbonate material coated with aluminium alloy. A very fine laser beam is
                projected to
                read and write data from and onto the disk. Some commonly used optical storage is CD-ROM, DVD and
                Blu-Ray (BD). The different types of optical storage are:

                    <li>2.2.1 CD-ROM:</li> It stands for Compact Disk- Read Only Memory. It is an optical storage
                    media
                    as it uses laser beam to access data from the disk. It can store up to 700mb of data and is
                    useful
                    to store large amounts of data like computer software, audio, video movies etc. Other types of
                    CD-ROM are CD-R and CD-RW.

                    of optical memory which can store a very large amount of data and information almost six times
                    more
                    than CD. It is also considered as improved form of CD-ROM and uses the same technology as that
                    of
                    CD-ROM for reading and writing data.

                2.3 Flash Memory: It is a non-volatile, erasable and programmable solid state memory which is
                made up of Semi-Conductor chip. It was first introduced in mid 1980's by Fujio Masuaka in Toshiba
                Corporation of Japan. It can be re-programmed at high speed and hence the name flash. It is derived
                from
                EEPROM. In Flash, the entire memory can be erased in a few seconds by using electric technology.
                Examples include memory card, pen-drive etc.

                Classification of computer on the Basis of Size

                As we know, technological development and precise engineering had drastically reduced the size of
                computers. Development of various electronic components are the major cause for reducing the size of
                the
                computer. Different types of computer on the basis of size are:

                <br><br>

                Super Computer: This computer are one of the fastest and powerful digital computer which can
                perform only a particular types of jobs such as weather forecasting, rocket launching, population
                counting etc. They were tremendously huge in size and are very expensive. Due to this reason they
                are
                not commercially successful. They are used by large corporations and government agencies. They were
                large in size hence, it occupy much more space and require temperature controlled room.

                <br><br>

                Mainframe Computer: This computer are also largest, fastest and perhaps one of the most expensive
                computer. Super computer are much more powerful and expensive but they are similar in size with
                mainframe computers. These computers have high processing unit and large storage capacity. This
                computer
                have multiple terminal. This computer can do big capacity of processing tasks such as population
                census,
                agro census, SLC result processing, governmental offices, industries etc. The first computer bought
                in
                Nepal in 2028 BS was IBM 1401, which was also a mainframe computer. This computer was bought in
                Nepal
                for population counting. Moreover, second computer bought in Nepal was ICL 2950/10 in 2038 BS which
                was
                also a mainframe computer brought for same purpose.

                <br><br>

                Mini Computer: This computer are smaller than mainframe computer and are more powerful and
                expensive compare with micro-computer. They use terminal and are connected with more than 50
                terminal at
                a time. Hence, it can handle much more amount of input and output than micro computer. The
                capability of
                mini computer is somewhere in between mainframe and micro computer. So, they are often called
                mid-range
                computer. This computer are used for medium size business, industries, universities, banks due to
                easy
                operation than mainframe computer. Eg, Data general, NECK, MAGNUM

                <br><br>

                Micro Computer: These are the smallest computer develop till date they use micro-processor as
                their major processing unit. Hence, they are called micro-computers. This computer are small and low
                cost digital computer. They are also called home computer or personal computer. This days we can
                find
                various micro computer that has various processing speed, storage, capacity and size according to
                cost.
                They are normally used in office, home, school, shop etc. Micro Computer are also found in various
                shape
                and size. They are desktop, Laptop and palmtop.

                <br><br>
                <menu>
                    <li>a. Desktop:</li> They are the personal computer which use micro-processor as a single chip
                    processing unit normally called CPU whose size are so small that they accommodate in a desk of a
                    user. Desktop also have various range of personal computer having several processing speed,
                    storage,
                    capacity and other features. This computer are out popular computer this days. So that, they are
                    used in various commercial field such as school, home, office, business and so on.

                    <br><br>
                    <li>b. Laptop:</li> This computer are highly portable micro computers and can be carried from
                    one
                    place to another easily like briefcase. They are so small that they can be fixed in a lap of a
                    user
                    and hence they are called laptop. They are mostly popular among traveller and the business man.
                    We
                    have to move from one place to another place for work and different reasons. Since, laptop comes
                    with battery backup, we don’t need to have direct A.C. supply. So, we can use without direct
                    connection of electricity. It high reliability, portability and flexibility.

                    <br><br>
                    <li>c. Palmtop/Handheld:</li> These are the most portable and smallest device that are develop
                    till
                    date. They are so highly portable that they can be carried easily inside the pocket of the user.
                    Due
                    to small in size they can be adjusted within the palm of the user. So, they are called Palmtop.
                    Several tablets, PDA (Personal Digital Assistant), smartphones are commonly used palmtop these
                    days.
                    This device also gave huge range of application ranging from game playing, internet surfing, and
                    other official needs and requirement. This device also comes with battery backup.

                <br><br><u>Introduction: Boolean Logic</u><br><br>
                Boolean Algebra is algebra of logic, which deals with the study of binary variables and logical
                operation. As every data are represented in terms binary values, we need to manipulate those values by
                using some certain rules and expression which we can do through Boolean algebra. It is most common and
                basic method to analysis and design logic circuit. It was introduced by an English mathematician George
                Boole. In Boolean algebra the variables can have only one of the two possible value 0 and1 (False or
                True). Every modern digital computers understand either this two values.
                <br><br>Boolean algebra: It is algebra of logic which could accept either of the possible two values 0
                and 1 and generate a result through logical relationship and operation.
                <br><br>Boolean variable: Those entities which has either or 0 and 1 and denote some specific operation
                ore known as boolean variable. Simply, it is an entity in Boolean algebra which has only either of the
                two possible values. This variable are denoted by A, B, P, Q, X, Y, Z….


                <br><br>Boolean function (logic functions): Boolean function is an expression formed by binary
                variables, binary operators such as AND, OR, NOT, parentheses, and equal sign for a given set of value
                this boolean function gives the 0 or 1 as a result.

                <br><br>Let us consider,<br><br>F = XYZ’+XY
                <br>Where, F is a boolean function

                <br>X, Y, Z are a boolean variable.

                Truth Table: A table which represents the input-output relationship between of the binary variables for
                each logical gate called truth table. It shows the relationship between input and output in tabular
                form. Thus, truth table is table representing the results the logical operation of the logical operation
                on all possible combination of logical values.
                <br><br>Boolean Operator and Operands:

                Operators are the symbols that define the specific operation. These are three basic operators used in
                Boolean Algebra, ie. AND, OR, NOT. Every other operations can be expressed in terms of this basic
                operation. For examples, NOR operator is the combination of NOT and OR operators. The three basic
                operators are:


                <br><br>a. AND Operators: AND operator is represented by “.” So, A AND B is represented by (A.B) . The
                result of the AND operation is exactly same as simple arithmetic multiplication. That means result will
                be high (1) only when both the inputs are high. Note: A AND B can also represented bu AˆB or AnB. Truth

                As we know stand alone hardware cannot do nothing, for the smooth operation of our Computer System there
                should be proper coordination between hardware and software. Software helps to mobilize the hardware and
                other resources. In order to mobilize hardware we have to write several set of instruction which
                instruct computer what to do, what not o. These set of instruction are collectively know as program and
                the term software is the collection of related programs and associated documents. In Order to produce
                useful output, hardware and software must work together. Nothing useful can be done with the hardware
                only and software cannot be utilize without hardware. The different types of software are:<br><br>

                1- System software: System software is set of one or more programs designed to control the operation of
                our computer system. This type of software doesn't fulfill the specific requirement of the user. They
                are general program written to assist human in the use of the computer system. In general system
                software support the running of other software, communicate with peripheral device, support the
                development of other types of software and monitors the use of various hardware resources. Thus, the
                system software makes the operation of the computer system more effective and efficient. The system
                software is categorized into two categories.<br>
                <br> 1.1 System Management: It is responsible for proper management and functioning of the computers
                system. All types of management between computer hardware and software is performed by system management
                software. There are 3 types of system management software:

                1.1.1 Operating System: Operating system is a collection program that controls the overall operation of
                the computer system. It is the 1st program that is loaded into memory when the computer is turned on. It
                provides platform for other application program to run and execute. It provides user with an interface
                so that uses can easily communicate with computer. For example Linux, Windows, Mac etc
                <br>
                1.1.2 Utility software: It is the supporting software which is used to perform specific task related to
                the maintenance of the computer system. Some of the utility software are included in operating system
                where as some are available as separate utility in market. They are also called service program. For
                example Norton Utility, PC tools, win zip etc
                <br>
                1.1.3 Device driver: A device driver is a software which is responsible for smooth functioning of the
                hardware device that is connected to the computer. When we add a new device to the computer, we need to
                install new software called device driver. Device driver will co-ordinate with the operating system and
                the newly installed hardware functions properly and smoothly.
                <br><br>
                1.2 System Development: It refers to set of programs that are use to develop computer program. This type
                of software are not used by a normal user of the computes. They are used by programmers for the
                development of new program. There are two types of system development software:
                <br>
                1.2.1 Programming language: The language with which we give instruction to the computer is known as
                programming language. Programming language are the set of different keywords, variable, operators, loops
                and other symbols etc. They help to make communication between computer and user. These are two types of
                programming language low level language and high level language.
                <br>
                1.2.2 Language translator: It is a special kind computer software which translates the programs written
                one language in another language. It is compulsory for both low and high level language. It is also
                called language processor. The types of language translator are compiler, interpreter and assembler.
                <br><br>
                2 Application Software: Application software is a set of one or more program which are design to do a
                specific task. It is made to fulfill the user demand. This program directs a computer to solve user
                oriented problem such as preparing bills, calculating mathematical equation, preparing mark sheet etc.
                The software that are develop for user purpose is called application software.These types of software
                are generally develop by using high level language. for example Ms-Excel, Photoshop, Billing software
                etc. There are two types of application software.<br><br>
                2.1 Packaged software: They are the generalized set of programs design and develop for general purpose.
                It is generally large sized, error-free, advance and standard software with much more functionality fir
                especial work. This type of software doesn't perfectly match the requirement of many organization or
                user. They cannot be changed easily are developed and designed by reputed software Company so they are
                trust worthy. They are expensive for small organization. for example Ms-Office, Adobe, Macromedia etc.
                <br><br>
                2.2 Customized /Tailored software: This is a software develop in high level language for special task.
                This types of software is developed for some specific purpose for solving specific problem of specific
                user or organization. The requirement on the user or organization can be perfectly matched. They can be
                changed easily since they are made by local programmer. for example: payroll system, inventory
                management, school management, billing software, mark sheet evaluation etc.

                <u>Operating System - Introduction</u>
                An operating system (OS) is an integrated set of program that controls overall resources such as CPU,
                memory, input-output device of the computer system. The major objective of operating system is to
                improve the performance and efficiency of a computer system. Like the manager of a company, an operating
                system is responsible for the smooth and efficient functioning of the entire computer system. The
                operating system provides the platform for other application program/software to run and execute. It
                provides user with an interface so that user can easily communicate with computers, which is more
                convenient to use and operate.

                <br><br>An operating system is a collection of program that controls the overall operation of the
                computer system. It also controls and co-ordinate the use of hardware, among the various application
                program for various user. So, it act as an interface between user and the computer hardware. The other
                major functions of operating system are:

                <br><br>
                <menu>
                    <li>It controls, monitor and co-ordinate overall operation of our computer system.</li>
                    <li>It act as an interface between user and computer.</li>
                    <li>It provide platform to develop, run and execute other computer program.</li>
                    <li>It manages hardware resources such as CPU, memories, input-output terminals, networking
                        equipment etc.</li>
                    <li>It hides programming and hardware complexity to the user.</li>
                </menu>
                The primary goal of an operating system is to maximize the productivity of a computer system by
                operating it in most efficient manner and maintaining the amount of human intervention. Some example of
                operating system are: MS-DOS, Windows, LINUX, MACOS, UNIX, Chrome, Fedora, Ubuntu etc.<br><br>

                <u>Functions / Features / Advantages of Operating System (OS) - V.imp
                </u>
                1) Input-Output (I/O) Management: Input-Output is essential to operate any computer. It allows computer
                to interact with several peripheral devices such as keyboard, mouse, printer, scanner etc.
                <br><br>
                2) User Interface (UI): User Interface means an ideal environment in which user can work on it so that
                s/he can interact with the computerized system. Every operating system provides the feature of user
                interface in order to enhance the experience and joy of using computer or any other computerized system.
                It act as a bridge between user and computer. There are 2 types of user Interface.<br><br>
                <menu>
                    <li>Character/Command User Interface ( CUI ): Eg MS-DOS
                    </li>
                    <li>Graphical User Interface (GUI ): Eg Windows, MAC OS
                    </li>
                </menu><br>
                3) Security: The operating system of a computer has a number of built-in tools to protect against
                security threats such as viruses, unauthorized access, suspicious network activity etc. The basic
                security in a OS is to control access to your computer by setting users and password.
                <br><br>
                4) Process Management: The process management allocates a processor to execute a chosen process. OS
                acts as a traffic controller, job scheduler, process scheduler and dispatcher.
                <br><br>
                5) Memory Management: Memory is a large array of bytes, each with its own address. When the user
                request CPU for read-write operation. OS determines the amount of memory required for the program
                instruction and data. Then OS allocates required memory to load the program and data into RAM. When
                the program terminates it freeze up the space and new program is loaded.
                <br><br>
                6) Data Management: Data management allows organizing their data into logical grouping called
                files.Earlier Operating system does not provide features of data management. Hence, they were
                inflexible but nowadays, every operating system provide this feature.
                <br><br>
                7) Command Interpreter: The command interpreter reads the command that a user types in at a
                terminal, interprets them and translate them into detail set of instruction that computer hardware
                can understand. Every operating system must have command interpreter for its operation.
                <br><br>
                8) Dead-Lock prevention: During processing a situation can arise in which a resources shared by two
                or more process cannot continue because the resources required by a process is held by other. This
                situation is known as dead lock. For eg. If process-1 allocates resources A and later required
                resources B and process-2 allocates resources B and later requires resources A. In this situation
                neither process-1 nor process-2 will be executed. Such situation is called deadlock. Operating
                system ensure prevention of deadlock by taking situation action by careful allocation of resources.
                <br><br>
                9) Time sharing: The function of OS that involves CPU to allocate time in a number of user on same
                computer. This property generally found in network operating system such as windows NT.
                <br><br>
                10) Virtual Memory: Virtual memory is the feature of an operating system that allows a computer to
                compensate for shortage of physical memory by transferring temporary files from RAM to disk. Virtual
                memory has twice as many address as main memory. The process of translating virtual address into
                real address is known as mapping. The copying of virtual pages from disk to main memory is
                swapping.<br><br>

                <u>A) On the basis of processing
                </u>
                1) Multi-programming OS: Multi-programming is used in multi-user environment. It is the technique in
                which multiple user program are executed simultaneously by single processor. Multi-programming means
                when two or more than two program are provided to the CPU for processing or loaded in the internal
                storage of CPU at the same instant of time. From the loaded program once the portion of one program is
                executed and the portion of another program is executed and so on. Thus, multi-programming refers to
                concurrent execution of several program. The main purpose of multi-programming is to increase the
                utilization of computer and its resources. Different forms of multi-programming OS are multi-tasking,
                multi-processing and multi-user.

                <br><br> 2) Multi-tasking OS: Multi-tasking OS allows more than one program to run concurrently mainly
                in a single user system. These computer are capable of executing several tasks or program at the same
                time. For executing several task it can be single or multi-processing system. In some multi-tasking
                system one of the process is called fore-ground (active) other are called background (inactive).
                Multi-tasking OS increase the productivity of the user by executing many task simultaneously. Some of
                the most common example are MS-Windows, Linux, MAC OS etc.

                <br><br>3) Multiprocessing OS: Multi-processing system has more than one processor linked in a
                coordinated way. Multiprocessing OS supports running a program in more than one CPU. Generally, super
                server are especially designed to support multiple processor. UNIX is commonly used multi-processing OS.
                Multi-programming and multiprocessing are no the same concept. Multi-programming involves concurrent
                execution of two or more programs by a single CPU, whereas multi-processing involves two or more
                processor (CPU) for controlling the different activities or execution of many program simultaneously.
                Multi-processing concept is also known as parallel processing. It is more costly and complex technique
                the multi-programming which dramatically increase the program execution speed of computer.
                <br><br>4) Time-Sharing OS: Time sharing is a technique which enable many people located in various
                terminal to use a particular computer system at a same time. Processors time which is shared among
                multiple user simultaneously is termed as time sharing. Multiple jobs are executed by the CPU by
                switching between then, but the switches occurs so frequently that user can receive a immediate
                response.
                <br><br>Advantages:

                <menu>
                    <li>Provide quick response.
                    </li>
                    <li>Reduce CPU idle time.
                    </li>
                </menu>
                Disadvantages:

                <menu>
                    <li>Problem of reliability.
                    </li>
                    <li>Less security.
                    </li>
                    <li>Integrity.
                    </li>
                </menu>
                5) Batch processing OS: Batch processing is a technique which requires grouping of similar jobs, which
                consists of program, data and system command. It is also known offline processing. This type of
                processing is suitable in program with large completion or involvement. For example, Payroll, Weather
                forecasting, Statistical analysis and many more. User need not wait while the job is being processed.
                They can submit their program to the operator and collect them later which means, the jobs are entered
                stored on a disk in a batch or queue and is executed one after another under the control of the OS.

                <br><br> Major disadvantage of batch processing is that it does not allow interaction between user and
                program during execution.

                <br><br>6) Multi-threading OS: A program in execution is known as process and can be divide into
                multiple smaller sub process. This sub-process are known as thread. Multi-threading OS has the ability
                to divide process into threads and execute them concurrently. Threads are individual process that
                execute simultaneously in multi-tasking OS.

                <br><br>7) Real time OS: Real time processing method is one that controls environment by receiving data
                and taking action quickly to affect the functioning of the environment at the same instant of time. It
                is an online processing system in which processing time is critical. The entire processing task has to
                be completed in the predefined time. The real time OS is suitable for following type of operation.

                <menu>
                    <li>Airlines or flight seat availability.
                    </li>
                    <li>Rocket Launching system
                    </li>
                    <li>Whole sell supplier and manufacturer. etc
                    </li>

                </menu>
                8) Online processing OS: It is a popular processing technique at present. In this method transaction are
                processed as soon as it happen at the place of its origin. It is quite simple compare to real time OS.
                In this type, user can interact or provides input during processing as well. The output is provided back
                to the user as soon as processing is completed.

                <br><br><u>B) On the basis of User Interface ( UI )
                </u> <br>A user interface allows user to interact with the computer system. It provides user with an
                ideal
                environment so that user can experience better computing. It brings structure to the interaction between
                user and computer. Without user interface it is almost impossible to operate a computer smoothly. Hence,
                in order to enhance the experience of using computer, UI plays vital role. Mainly there are 2 types of
                User Interface (UI).

                <br><br>
                <menu>

                    </li>

                </menu>
                1) Character User Interface (CUI): It is a type of operating system in which whole computer operates or
                depend upon the command issued by user. All the operations that take place in CUI have their own
                specific command. Hence, they are known as Character User Interface. User have to remember all the
                command need to operate the computers. So, they are non user friendly. Only the people people having
                technical knowledge would operate this type of operating system. It is primitive type of OS, in which
                graphics, pictures, icons, drop-down menu, dialogue box etc are not used which make it more difficult to
                use. It uses the character or text mode of computer such as DOS and UNIX. A command prompt is a sequence
                of character used in CUI. Commands are typed in to instruct computer. MS-DOS is a Character User
                Interface operating system.

                <br><br>The major advantage of this type of OS is they can have quick response as long as user enters
                correct command whereas, the disadvantages of command driven User Interface is that, they are very
                difficult to use if the user is beginner and doesn't know correct command. However, it can be used in
                older system with no processing capabilities and low storage.

                </menu>
                2) Graphical User Interface (GUI): It is a type of operating system in which computer are operated just
                by clicking or selecting the required icon or dialogue box instead of writing a direct command to the
                system. Since graphics like icons, pictures, drop-down menus, dialogue boxes etc are used which makes it
                more user-friendly than CUI. Since, user doesn't have to remember a single command, every user without
                technical knowledge can also use this type of OS. Due to user friendly interface, they are simple to use
                and widely used for domestic application. The goal of graphical operating system is to create a system
                that the computer user can turn on and operate in right way without any training or by remembering
                commands. The main advantages of GUI is that they are easy to use especially for beginners. The main
                disadvantage of GUI is they consume more memory for operation.Windows, MAC OS etc are the example of
                GUI.
                <br>The first Graphical User Interface was designed by Xerox corporations Palo's Alto research center in
                1970's, but it was not popular whereas in until the 1980's the emergence of Apple Macintosh that use GUI
                became popular.

                GUI environment have following basic components.

                <br><br>Icon: Icons are the small pictures that represent commands, files or windows.


                <br><br>Pointer: A symbol (usually angled arrow) that appears on the display screen and that are moved
                to select objects and commands. They are controlled by a pointing device such as a mouse, track pad,
                light pens etc.


                <br><br>Desktop: The area on the display screen where icons are grouped is refereed as desktop.


                <br><br>Windows: Windows are displayed on screen and we can change their shape and size at will. Each
                windows can run a different program or display different information.


                <br><br>Menus: Most graphical user interface let us to execute commands by selecting a choice from a
                menu.


                <br><br>Folders: Graphical representation of a directory.

                <u>On the mode of user:</u><br><br>There are two types of OS on the basic of mode of user.

                <menu>
                    <li>Single User.</li>
                    <li>Multi User</li>
                </menu>
                1) Singe User: A single user OS is a type of OS that is develop and intended for use on a computer or
                similar machine that will only have a single user at any given time. This is the most common type of OS
                used on a home computer as well as on computer in office or other work environment. There are two
                general type of single user system. Single user single tasking and another is single user multi tasking.
                The example of single user single tasking are not much ore feasible for general purpose computing. For
                eg MS-DOS, PC-DOS etc

                <br><br>2) Multi User: Multi user OS is computer operating system that allows multiple user on different
                terminal to access a single system with one OS in it . A multi user OS differs from a single user system
                on network, in that each user is accessing same OS at different machine. The multi user OS shares
                computer resources among different users, allowing each user a small slice of the processor time. This
                concept is also known as time sharing. Due to that, it gives the user the impression that they are all
                being served simultaneously even though the OS serves them one at a time for example: Linux, UNIX etc.

                <br><br><u>Some important Operating System in use:
                </u>
                <br><br>Open source Operating System: Open source generally refers to those applications which source
                code is freely available in the internet to the world wide user. Basically, the software that falls
                under general public license are open source software. User can customize the source code of the open
                source software according to the user requirements. They need not buy the license to use the software.
                Source code can be modified and re-distributed to any other person legally. This software are free of
                cost. Some of the examples of Open Source Software are Linux, Unix, Mozilla, Apache etc. Similarly, Open
                Source operating system are those operating system whose program code are open to all the user. Some
                common examples of open source operating system are Linux, Unix, Minix, Open Solaris etc.

                <br><br>UNIX: UNIX is a powerful flexible and manageable operating system with good utilities and
                communication abilities. It is multi-user, multi-tasking and multi-processing operating system. It is
                used in bigger size machine like mainframe and mini computer. It was develop by AT&T Bell lab around
                1970 AD. UNIX is developed in C and Assembly language. The development of the UNIX has given birth to
                many operating system such as Linux, Solaris etc. These operating system inherits its main feature from
                UNIX.

                <br><br>Linux: It is open source powerful UNIX based operating system, that can run on variety of
                platform including Intel, Power PC, DEC Alpha processor as well as multiprocessing system. It was
                developed by Linux Torvalds at the university of Helsinki as a college project. He release the version
                of Linux including all the source code. It is user develop product, meaning that user around the world
                who ran this OS for their own use have develop many of its components and drivers. It is multi-user,
                multi-tasking and multi-programming OS mainly popular for server system. It is distributed through
                different distributor such as Red Hat, Open USE, Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Granular Linux, Mandriva etc

                <br><br>MAC OS: MAC OS is a popular GUI based OS for Apple Inc. It is used in Apple Macintosh computer.
                It has very high quality graphical user interface. Earlier version of this OS were only compatible with
                motorola 68000 series of processors but now they are compatible with Intel processors also.

                <br><br><u>Some terminologies related with OS.
                </u>
                <br><br>Spooling: These process is used to balance the difference in speed of high speed CPU and slow
                speed input-output device. It is primarily used for printing purpose. When we provide multiple file to
                print to printer together, although printer can print one file at a time. But, all file get lined up in
                a queue and get printed one by one. In this process, CPU remains free and user can work on other
                application. These technique of printing is possible through a capability of operating system known as
                spooling. The term spooling is derive from the term SPOOL ( Simultaneous Peripheral Operation On Line ).

                <br><br>Process: A process is basically a program in execution. It doesn't mean a program. Program
                itself is a static while process is dynamic. For simplicity we can define program as a job that resides
                into the secondary storage ( which is not loaded in main memory ). A process is a program which is
                currently in running or ready state ( which is loaded in main memory ). A process in a computer maybe in
                a different possible state.

                <menu>
                    <li>Running state: A process is said to be in running state if it is currently running in the
                        processor.
                    </li>
                    <li>Ready state: A process is said to be in ready state if it is temporary stopped to let other
                        process run in the processor.
                    </li>
                    <li>Blocked state: A process is said to be in blocked state if it is unable to run until some
                        external events happens.
                    </li>

                </menu>
                Thread: A single process is divided into multiple sub-process and even once of process goes for
                input-output operation another piece of same process start executing. This minimize the burden of
                context switching to some extend. When multiple process are loaded in a memory at once. When one process
                goes in blocked or ready state, another process is chosen by the scheduler to be in running state.
                During this phase, the current state of previously running process must be stored somewhere, so that it
                can resume from that state at the next time. This mechanism is known as context switching. It is very
                costly operation and it reduces efficiency. To solve such problem newer operating system use the
                mechanism of threading ( Light-weight process ).

                <br><br>
                Scheduling: When more than one process are run the operating system must decide which one to run first.
                This part of OS concerned with this decision is called scheduler and the algorithm it use is called
                scheduling algorithm. Scheduling can be two types.
                <menu>
                    <li>
                        Priority scheduling: Each program or job is assigned with a priority set to the program. In this
                        scheduling job or program having highest priority are treated first or selected to run. The only
                        demerits of this scheduling that small job may have to wait for longer period of time due to
                        having less priority.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Time-sharing scheduling: Each program loaded in a memory are given fixed amount of time to
                        execute. Every program that are to be executable have equal processing time. So that none of the
                        job depends upon the time taken by another job while processing.

                    </li>
                </menu>
                Buffering: A buffer is a small, high-speed storage device, located in I/O units, used to hold data at
                the time of input/output operations. So it is divided into the input buffer and output buffer. Input
                buffer accepts data as low speed and release at high speed at CPU, output buffer works in reverse order,
                it accepts data at high speed from main memory and releases at low speed to output device. Buffering is
                the process of using buffer during I/O operation. The term buffering is also used while accessing files
                like audio/video through the internet. Here, it is the process of holding downloaded data before it can
                be played.


                <br><br>
                Virtual Memory: In a multi-programming system, when we use multiple programs at the same time, the space
                of primary memory (RAM) may not be enough to store all the programs. In this case, operating system uses
                free space of secondary memory to store these data. This free space in secondary memory, used to store
                the contents of primary memory temporarily is known as virtual memory. An operating system is
                responsible for creating, managing and operating virtual memory.
                It is not an actual memory but it is a technique used by operating system to execute large size program
                with small size available primary memory. This is done by dividing the larger program into small size
                segments known as pages.

                </u><br><br>
                Introduction: Ms-Word is a text editing or word processing software develop by Microsoft Corporation,
                USA under MS-Office package. Word processing refers to use of computer to create, edit and print
                documents. A word processor enables us to create a document, store it electronically in a disk, display
                it on a screen, modify it by entering commands and characters from keyboard and print it on a printer.
                MS-Word is a windows based application it has many powerful and advance feature to manipulate the
                document, With the help of this program we can create any types of documents like letters, reports,
                thesis, manuals, brochures, advertisement an many other document. Beside creating, editing and modifying
                the documents MS-Word provides some special facilities such as checking spelling and grammatical error,
                to search for synonyms and antonyms, to work with columns, tables, special symbols, pictures, graphs,
                charts and many more. The document created with MS-Word have “.doc” extension. The newer version of
                MS-Word has newer extension “.docx”".

                <br><br><u>Features of MS-Word
                </u>
                <br><br>
                a. Fast operation: Since, MS-Word is a digital text editing software there is no any mechanical movement
                associated. Hence, it is faster in operation.


                <br><br>
                b. Editing text feature (Character formatting): Any type of operation like insert, delete, modify the

                It allows us to store data electronically in any storage medium.<br>
                <br><br><u>Cell reference in Excel (V.imp)
                </u><br><br>A cell location in a spreadsheet is referred to as its cell reference. To find a cell
                reference, simply look at column heading to find which column the cell is in and across to find which
                row it is in. The cell reference is a combination of column letter and row number such as A1, B3, Z9 …
                When writing cell reference the column letter should always comes first. Specially cell reference is
                very important while writing formula or addressing the cell to evaluate the cell. For eg, if we want to
                add values 3 and 2 which are in A1 and A2 respectively, instead of writing A3=3+2 we write A3=A1+A2

                <br><br>There are two types of cell reference.

                <br><br>Relative cell reference: In excel, a relative cell reference identifies the location of the cell
                or group of cell. Cell reference are used in formula, functions, charts and other excel commands. By
                default a spreadsheet cell reference is relative cell reference. This means, the formula and functions
                can be copied and posted to other cell. A relative cell consist of column letter and row number and
                intersect at the cell location, An example of relative cell reference would be A1, B4, G9 etc.

                <br><br>Absolute cell reference: In Excel, an absolute cell reference identifies the location of cell or
                group of cell which also contain column letter and row number surrounded by dollar sign($). An example
                of absolute cell reference would be $A$2, $G$9, $Z$345 etc. An easy way to add dollar sign us to click
                on cell reference and then press “F4” key from keyboard. An absolute cell reference is use when you want
                a cell reference to stay fixed on a specific cell, which means formula and functions can be copied and
                posted to other cell the formula and function doesn't change.

            <div class="text6">

<br><br>

<u>Introduction:</u>

<br><br>

<p>Computers, by themselves, cannot perform actions unless they are given specific commands. These commands are given in the form of a programming language, and the set of instructions to carry out specific tasks is called a program. Multiple programs can be combined to form software, which performs various functions. However, since computers do not understand programming languages directly, there is a need for a language translator (assembler, compiler, or interpreter) to convert the program into machine-readable language. The program written by the programmer is called the source program, and after translation, it becomes an executable program.</p>

<br><br>

<u>Qualities of Good Programs:</u>

<br><br>

<menu>
    <li>Easy to understand</li>
    <li>Error-free (correct)</li>
    <li>Reliable</li>
    <li>User-friendly interface</li>
    <li>Portable and flexible</li>
</menu>

<br><br>

<u>Programming Language:</u>

<br><br>

<p>Programming languages are the means of communication between the user and the computer, consisting of keywords, operators, loops, variables, and other elements. The process of writing programs is called programming, and the person who writes them is known as a programmer.</p>

<br><br>

<u>Types of Programming Languages:</u>

<br><br>

<u>1. Low-Level Language:</u>

<br><br>

<p>These are machine-dependent languages, meaning a program written for one system cannot run on another. Low-level programming requires detailed knowledge of the system's architecture and is time-consuming and challenging. They include:</p>

<br><br>

<u>a. Machine Level Language (1GL):</u>

<br><br>

<p>A sequence of binary digits (0s and 1s) understood directly by the processor. It offers high execution speed but is difficult to program and debug.</p>

<br><br>

<menu>
    <li>High execution speed since they are directly understood by the processor</li>
    <li>No need for a language processor in some cases</li>
    <li>Useful for programming specific-purpose computers</li>
</menu>

<br><br>

<menu>
    <li>Difficult and time-consuming to develop and debug programs</li>
    <li>Machine-dependent, limiting portability</li>
    <li>Binary syntax is hard to remember and work with</li>
</menu>

<br><br>

<u>b. Assembly Language (2GL):</u>

<br><br>

<p>Uses mnemonics (symbolic instructions) like ADD, SUB, etc., making it easier than machine language but still machine-dependent. An assembler is required to convert it into machine code.</p>

<br><br>

<menu>
    <li>Easier to write, debug, and understand compared to machine level language</li>
    <li>Higher execution speed compared to high-level languages</li>
    <li>Used for developing device drivers</li>
</menu>

<br><br>

<menu>
    <li>Machine-dependent, limiting portability</li>
    <li>More complex due to the use of mnemonics</li>
    <li>More difficult and time-consuming to develop and debug compared to high-level languages</li>
</menu>

<br><br>

<u>2. High-Level Language (HLL):</u>

<br><br>

<p>High-level languages resemble English and use mathematical notations, making them easier to understand and debug. They are machine-independent, meaning a program written on one system can run on another. However, since they aren't directly understood by computers, they need a compiler or interpreter to translate them into machine language. Examples include C, Python, and JavaScript.</p>

<br><br>

<menu>
    <li>Easier to write, debug, and understand due to English-like syntax</li>
    <li>Machine-independent, promoting portability</li>
    <li>Faster program development with less effort required</li>
</menu>

<br><br>

<menu>
    <li>Slower execution compared to low-level languages</li>
    <li>Requires translation into machine code</li>
</menu>

<br><br>

<u>High-Level Language Classification:</u>

<br><br>

<u>a. Procedural-Oriented Language (3GL):</u>

<br><br>

<p>Focuses on procedures or functions. This approach is more complex for large programs but is widely used for general-purpose programming. Examples include C, FORTRAN, and QBasic.</p>

<br><br>

<menu>
    <li>Easier program development and debugging</li>
    <li>Machine-independent</li>
    <li>Used to develop user-friendly software</li>
</menu>

<br><br>

<menu>
    <li>Requires a language processor (e.g., a compiler)</li>
    <li>Slower program execution</li>
    <li>Less data security compared to other languages</li>
</menu>

<br><br>

<u>b. Object-Oriented Language (4GL):</u>

<br><br>

<p>Focuses on data and allows the user to specify what the output should be, not how to manipulate the data. It uses features like data encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Examples include C++, Java, and C#.</p>

<br><br>

<menu>
    <li>Suitable for developing web-based applications and software</li>
    <li>Machine-independent</li>
    <li>Easier development of user-friendly software</li>
</menu>

<br><br>

<menu>
    <li>Requires a language processor (e.g., a compiler)</li>
    <li>Slower execution than low-level languages</li>
    <li>Difficult to develop hardware-oriented applications</li>
</menu>

<br><br>

<u>c. Natural Language (5GL):</u>

<br><br>

<p>A developing programming language that uses common human language to write programs, resembling normal sentences. For example, in PROLOG, one might write: "Who are the salesmen who sold more than 30,000 products last month?"</p>

<br><br>

<menu>
    <li>Easy to develop and debug programs</li>
    <li>Machine-independent</li>
    <li>User-friendly programming environment</li>
</menu>

<br><br>

<menu>
    <li>Requires a language processor</li>
    <li>Slower program execution</li>
    <li>Difficult to develop hardware-oriented applications</li>
</menu>

<br><br>

<u>Language Translator/Processor:</u>

<br><br>

<p>A language translator converts a program written in assembly or high-level language (source program) into machine-level language (object program). These translators make it easier to write code in higher-level languages rather than in binary.</p>

<br><br>

<menu>
    <li><b>Assembler:</b> Converts assembly language code into machine language. It performs the translation quickly since assembly language is close to machine code.</li>
    <li><b>Compiler:</b> A language processor that translates a high-level language program into machine code all at once. Examples include C, C++, and Java. While this method is efficient, it can make debugging complex and time-consuming.</li>
    <li><b>Interpreter:</b> Converts high-level language code into machine code one statement at a time. It makes debugging easier and quicker than a compiler, but the program execution is slower. Examples include BASIC, PHP, and Python.</li>
</menu>

<br><br>

<u>Difference Between Compiler and Interpreter:</u>

<br><br>

<menu>
    <li><b>Compiler:</b> Translates the entire program at once into machine code before execution, making it faster at runtime but slower during development due to longer compilation time. It also makes debugging more complex.</li>
    <li><b>Interpreter:</b> Translates one statement at a time and executes it immediately, which makes it slower at runtime but easier to debug and modify during development.</li>

            <u>Introduction to HTML</u><br><br>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It defines the structure of a webpage by using a series of tags and attributes. HTML was developed by Tim Berners-Lee and is based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language). The language has evolved through multiple versions, including HTML, HTML+, HTML 1.0, HTML 2.0, HTML 3.2, HTML 4.01, and HTML 5.0. HTML is used to:
<menu>
    <li>Create the basic layout and design of a webpage.</li>
        <li>Embed multimedia elements such as images, audio, and video.</li>
            <li>Format text, including bold, italic, and underlined styles.</li>
                <li>Create hyperlinks and lists.</li>
</menu>

<u>Advantages of HTML
</u><br><br>HTML is user-friendly, compatible with all browsers and operating systems, and easy to learn. It allows for quick loading times and is widely supported by search engines. HTML also benefits from constant updates, such as the advanced features found in HTML 5.0.
<br><br>
<u>Disadvantages of HTML
</u><br><br>While HTML is essential for basic webpage creation, it has limitations. It can't create dynamic webpages on its own and is not a programming language. It also has compatibility issues, and there is no universally accepted standard for HTML.

<u>Tags</u><br><br>HTML tags are instructions used by browsers to organize and display web content. Tags are written within angle brackets (< >), and they can be divided into two types: pair tags (which have both an opening and closing tag) and singular tags (which only have an opening tag). Tags are often enhanced with attributes, which provide additional features like background color, text color, and images.

Webpage and Website Terminology
A webpage is a single HTML document that displays content on the web, while a website is a collection of interrelated webpages. The home page is the introductory page that loads when accessing a website. A web browser is an application used to access and display webpages. The URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address that identifies a specific resource on the web.

Database Management System (DBMS)
A DBMS is software that manages the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data within a database. It ensures that data is organized efficiently for quick access. Examples include MS Access, MySQL, and Oracle. DBMSs are essential for managing large datasets, improving security, and reducing data redundancy.

Advantages of DBMS
DBMS offers several benefits, including fast data retrieval, better data security, reduced redundancy, and improved consistency. It also supports data sharing across networks and provides an organized structure for storing and managing data.

Disadvantages of DBMS
Despite its benefits, DBMSs can be costly to install and maintain, require significant disk space, and may involve privacy and security concerns. They also require skilled personnel to manage and maintain the system effectively.

    <u>Introduction:</u>
    
    <br><br>
    
    <p>Multimedia consists of two words: 'Multi' and 'Media,' where 'multi' means many and 'media' refers to ways or mediums of expressing information. Therefore, multimedia is the method of presenting information in various forms such as text, audio, video, graphics, and animation. The integration of these different media types is used to enhance communication and understanding. By combining these media, information can be illustrated more effectively. A multimedia computer system integrates multimedia hardware and software, enabling the combination of text, audio, video, animation, and graphics for better communication. Examples of multimedia hardware include printers, projectors, webcams, microphones, and digital cameras. Software like text editors (MS Word), presentation tools (PowerPoint), photo editors (Photoshop), video editors (iMovie), and accounting packages (Tally) help in the creation and integration of multimedia content. For example, video is created by combining audio and images.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 8. Information Security and Cyber Law</h2>

<br><br>

<u>1. What is Information Technology? Describe it with its social impacts.</u>

<br><br>

<p>Information Technology is a modern concept or methodology of communication. It is the combined form of Information and Communication Technology, which is highly used for the information flow and in many other fields. IT has made the world closer day by day. One can easily send and receive the message throughout the world within a second. It has been widely used in education, industry, banks, research centers, hospitals, etc. It is being used as a learning and teaching tool in the sector of education. Distant learning has become possible due to the advancement of IT. It has been highly used in the industries to control quantity and quality of the product. It is equally used for management in hospitals and for the treatment of patients. IT is being used in the sector of animation and other entertainment. Scientists can use computers or IT for their research and experiments. Space technology has become possible due to IT. Thus, it has a positive impact on society. However, there are negative impacts as well. As the use of IT increases, cyber crimes also increase. Cybercriminals can easily steal others' information or data, disclose secrecy, and spread viruses in the network, disturbing social peace and security.</p>

<br><br>

<u>Information Security</u>

<br><br>

<p>In a network or cyberspace, there is always a threat of cyberattacks that may lead to the loss and damage of our precious data and information. It is necessary to be aware of such malicious activity. We need to adopt different measures while using a computer to protect against intentional and accidental threats. Information security refers to the process of protecting our network infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, modification, destruction, or any malfunction. Several physical and software preventive measures can protect us from such unethical activities. Information security helps create a secure environment for computers, users, and programs.</p>

<br><br>

<p>Information security can mitigate security threats and attacks. A security threat is a potential danger that might cause unwanted activities in a computer system, breaching security and causing harm. A security attack is an attempt to gain unauthorized access to destroy, expose, steal, or alter valuable data and information. These attacks can be triggered by malicious applications such as viruses, spyware, Trojan horses, and worms.</p>

<br><br>

<p>Information security is built around three major objectives:</p>

<menu>
    <li><b>Confidentiality:</b> Information is available only to authorized individuals, ensuring that others cannot use or process it without proper authorization.</li>
    <li><b>Integrity:</b> Accuracy and completeness of data and information, ensuring that data cannot be tampered with without proper authorization.</li>
    <li><b>Availability:</b> Information must always be available as needed, meaning valuable data can be accessed quickly when required.</li>
</menu>

<br><br>

<u>Cryptography</u>

<br><br>

<p>The term cryptography comes from the Greek word meaning "Secret writing." It is the art and science of hiding information and provides security for information. Cryptography is used for secure communication between individuals, government agencies, and military forces. Cryptography generally refers to encryption and decryption. Encryption is the process of converting plaintext (a readable message) into an unreadable format so that anyone who tries to view the message cannot read the original content. The plaintext is converted into unreadable text using special algorithms and keys. This unreadable text is called ciphertext. Decryption is the reverse process of encryption, where ciphertext is converted back into a readable form. Encryption is sometimes referred to as encoding or enciphering, while decryption is called decoding or deciphering.</p>

<br><br>

<u>2. What is Digital Divide?</u>

<br><br>

<p>The digital divide refers to the gap between people who are computer literate and those who are not. It signifies a division between those with technical knowledge and those without, particularly in the field of Information Technology. IT is a modern technology, and its effective use requires a sound understanding of computers. However, many people still lack knowledge of computer operations and terms. This gap is known as the digital divide, which became prominent in the mid-1990s through political speeches and media discussions. The divide continues to grow, particularly between urban and rural populations, educated and uneducated individuals, and rich and poor communities. Governments worldwide are working to bridge this gap.</p>

<br><br>

<u>3. What are Computer Ethics or Cyber Ethics?</u>

<br><br>

<p>Computer ethics, also known as cyber ethics, are a set of moral principles or codes of conduct that should be followed by computer professionals. The goal of these ethics is to prevent criminal activities through the use of computers. Some examples of computer ethics include:</p>

<menu>
    <li>Do not use someone else's password.</li>
    <li>Do not steal others' information.</li>
    <li>Do not use computers to harm others.</li>
